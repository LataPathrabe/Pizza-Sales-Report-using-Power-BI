# Pizza-Sales-Report-using-Power-BI
Creating a pizza sale report using Power BI and SQL involves integrating data from a SQL database into Power BI, designing visualizations to represent the data, and generating insights into pizza sales. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Database Setup: Begin by setting up a SQL database to store pizza sale data. This database should contain tables for sales transactions, customer information, pizza types, and any other relevant data.

2. Data Extraction: Use SQL queries to extract relevant data from the SQL database. This may include information such as sales date, pizza type, quantity sold, customer details, etc.

3. Data Transformation: Transform the extracted data if necessary. This may involve cleaning data, merging tables, creating calculated columns, or aggregating data to prepare it for analysis.

4. Power BI Integration: Open Power BI and connect to the SQL database as a data source. Use the SQL queries or views created earlier to import the required data into Power BI.

5. Data Modeling: Design a data model in Power BI by creating relationships between different tables imported from the SQL database. This step is crucial for building accurate visualizations later.

6. Visualization Design: Design various visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and tables to represent pizza sale data. For example:
   - Bar chart showing sales revenue by month
   - Pie chart displaying the distribution of pizza types sold
   - Line chart illustrating sales trends over time

7. Dashboard Creation: Arrange the visualizations on a dashboard within Power BI. This dashboard will serve as the central hub for analyzing pizza sale data.

8. Interactivity: Enhance interactivity by adding filters, slicers, and other interactive elements to the dashboard. This allows users to dynamically explore the data based on their preferences.

9. Insights and Analysis: Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into pizza sales. Identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. For example, identify the best-selling pizza types, peak sales hours, or customer demographics.
